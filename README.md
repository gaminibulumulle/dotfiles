# Getting started

# Status: `UNSTABLE`

> Currently I'm re-modeling my config files. As of right now, my dotfiles are unstable for use. 

In order to copy the dotfiles over to your system, make sure the dotfiles is cloned
in your home directory in-order to get everything working properly. 

```sh
cd
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/senalbulumulle/dotfiles/
```

```sh
sh config-install.sh
sh config-install-classic.sh
## This one is currently unstable at the moment. 
sh config-install-new.sh
```

# TODO:

> Make more boilerplates with examples on them.
