# Fedora Linux ARM


Welcome to this documentation, this documentation talks about Senal's setup for 
Fedora Linux ARM


Some of the dependencies for Fedora Linux ARM that Senal uses like the Kitty Terminal
and other like that does not work, apparently. Just to let you know.


Eventually, once this bug is fixed, Senal will let you know.
